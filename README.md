# gun-annoyance-remove
Removes the console log from gundb beause it's rude to put involuntary console logs in library code

Add this package to your devDependencies and call it from postinstall to remove the console logs.

Note from the developer:
;"Please do not remove welcome log unless you are paying for a monthly sponsorship, thanks!";
